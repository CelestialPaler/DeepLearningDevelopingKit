## Brief Introduction
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerful modularization and expandability provide a great tool to learn about machine learning, especially deep learning.You can explore as you wish, build your dream software, without being bothered by intricate codes.You can  build our own AI model quickly and train it through iterator in high-efficiency.Like Lego building blocks, you can assemble or transplant your models and apply them to your AI applications.</p> 

Programing Language: *C++*

Feature:

*   Simple and intuitive.
*   High-efficiency
*   Modulariztion
*   Expandability

## Developing Status
Under developing:
*   Layer and Module
*   Port for flexibility in linking Modules
*   Acceleration using CUDA
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still an early stage of development. So, it`s welcomed for anyone to contribute to this project. Feel free to upload your code or pull a request. More than anything, please share your idea and give me some precious advices. XD</p>
