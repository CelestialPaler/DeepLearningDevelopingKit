## Brief Introduction
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerful modularization and expandability provide a great tool to learn about machine learning, especially deep learning.You can explore as you wish, build your dream software, without being bothered by intricate codes. You can build your own AI model quickly and train it through iterator in high-efficiency.Like Lego building blocks, you can assemble or transplant your models and apply them to your AI applications within several minutes.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programing Language:</p> 

*   C/C++
*   Python

Feature:

*   Simple and intuitive
*   High-efficiency
*   Modularization
*   Expandability
*   Customization

## Developing Status
Under developing:

*   Json Handler both in C++ and Python
*   Basic data visualizer based on python
*   Data Set Management
*   Util functions for nerual network training
*   Data Generator

Further plan (Not in top priority):

*   Visualization tool using SFML or Python
*   Acceleration using CUDA
